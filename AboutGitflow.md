# About Github
Gitflow is a branching model created by Vincent Driessen that is optimized for collaboration projects. It is perfect for working on a project simultaneously with other developers by working on “branches” - separate sections of code - that will not affect the master branch (main file of code) without approving and merging it into the main file. Observing these branches can be done through the “checkout” command, which lets you observe the different branches of code.
