#About VCS

In todays world, it has never been more important to be able to work and collaborate remotely. But for some people, working remote has always been an essential part to get day to day work done. 
Version control systems like Git allow people to work and collaborate on projects no matter where they are. Being able to work on project anytime and anywhere allows for greater productivity. Git and GitHub enables people to stay up to date on projects, make changes and track those changes whether they were done by you or a peer. You are not bound to being in an office or being in a room with your coworkers to get a job done. 
Docker was designed to make deploying and running applications easier by using containers. This software container platform resolves the issue of developers application working on one platform and not another. This can be a major complication when working on a project because it wastes time and money. When being able to make an application work on multiple platforms from the get go, you are able to increase productivity by not having to work out any kinks or bugs.

##Branch
Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes.

Example: Use when adding new parts to a project to easily go back and make edits if necessary

##Commit
Compares a new version to a previous version

Example: Use when you want to save changes to a local repository 

##Merge
